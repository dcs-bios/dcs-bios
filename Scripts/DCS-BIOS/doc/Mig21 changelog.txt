- Made the following changes:
	Altered the formatting of the code to make it easier to read and reduce the likelihood of bugs/errors 	arising from spelling issues

	Altered the order of the controls to the order used in clickabledata.lua, making searching/comparing easier

- Fixed the following bugs:
	Corrected an issue in the ARU speed toggle and the trim adjustment switch where the switches would move in 		both directions, but only perform one of the two actions.

- Added all remaining clickable controls from the clickabledata.lua. Note that some controls have no effect at this time; They were added for the sake of completeness, and in case Leatherneck Simulations decides to do more with them later on in the MiG's development. Controls added by panel are:

	Center Lower:
