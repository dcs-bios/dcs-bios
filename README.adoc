DCS-BIOS is a community-maintained `Export.lua` file for use with http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/[DCS: World].
It provides a stable, documented interface for external hardware and software to interact with the clickable cockpit of a DCS: World aircraft.

== For Panel Builders

You don't need to be a programmer or electrical engineer.
The link:Scripts/DCS-BIOS/doc/userguide.{link-ext}[DCS-BIOS User Guide] will show you step by step how to connect your panel to DCS using DCS-BIOS and the beginner-friendly http://arduino.cc[Arduino microcontroller platform].
You don't have to write any program code yourself.

== For Software Developers

The link:Scripts/DCS-BIOS/doc/developerguide.{link-ext}[Developer Guide] explains how to connect to and interpret the DCS-BIOS export data stream and how to send commands to DCS-BIOS to operate controls inside the cockpit.

* A-10C
* UH-1H
