== Connecting to DCS-BIOS

DCS-BIOS communicates over UDP.

Controls in the cockpit can be manipulated by sending newline-terminated plain text commands to UDP port 7778.
The syntax is described in the <<The DCS-BIOS Import Protocol>> section.

The current state of cockpit indicators and controls is exported from DCS using a binary protocol (see <<The DCS-BIOS Export Protocol>>). This data is sent via UDP to multicast address 239.255.50.10, port 5010 on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1).

WARNING: When opening a UDP socket to listen on 239.255.50.10:5010, you must specify the `allowreuseaddr` socket option.
Otherwise Windows will prevent other programs from listening to the same data stream.

NOTE: The IPv4 multicast address block 239.255.0.0/16 is defined in RFC 2365 as the "IPv4 Local Scope".
It is part of the "Administratively Scoped IPv4 Multicast Space", which is to multicast as the private address ranges 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16 and 172.16.0.0/12 are to unicast Ipv4.

If you cannot or do not want to deal with multicast UDP, you can also make DCS-BIOS send a copy of the export data stream to a unicast address by editing `BIOSConfig.lua`.

You can also use the `socat` utility to connect a serial port (and just about anything else that can be read or written) to the DCS-BIOS import and export streams.
For an example, take a look at the batch files that come with DCS-BIOS.

== The DCS-BIOS Import Protocol

Commands are sent to DCS-BIOS as lines of plain text.

A command consists of a control identifier, a space, an argument and a newline character.

NOTE: The import protocol does not use binary encodings.
Handling binary data in Lua with only the libraries that come with DCS is cumbersome.
Also, a plain text protocol is easier to explain, understand and debug.
In the input direction, the added verbosity of a plain text protocol is no problem because a human pilot will not flip 20 switches 30 times a second.

To find out the arguments that a certain control accepts, refer to the reference documentation and look up _input interfaces_ in the User Guide.

== The DCS-BIOS Export Protocol

The export stream protocol is designed to be as space-efficient as possible to enable the export of the complete cockpit state over a 115200 bps serial connection.

Each piece of cockpit state is encoded as an integer or a string and is assigned an address within a 16-bit address space.

=== Integer Values

The location of an integer value is defined by a 16-bit word address which specifies the start of the 16-bit word in which the data is located, a 16-bit mask which specifies which bits in that word belong to the value, and a shift value (which can also be deduced from the mask).

Given the start address, mask and shift values, the following pseudo C code decodes a value:
[code,c]
----
char[] state;
unsigned int value = (((uint16_t*)state)[start_address<<2] & mask) << shift
----

Changes to the state data are encoded as write accesses to this address space and written to the export data stream in the following format:

`<start address (16 bit)>` `<data length (16 bit)>` `data`

Both the start address and the data length will always be even (internally, DCS-BIOS treats the data as a list of 16-bit integers).
This ensures that no write access partially updates an integer value (an integer may occupy no more than 16 bit).

=== String Values

The location of a string is defined by its 16-bit start address and the length in bytes (all string values have a fixed maximum length and start on a 16-bit aligned address).

A string value with a maximum length greater than two characters can be updated partially.
To avoid inconsistent intermediate states, an application that receives DCS-BIOS export data should apply changes to string values at the next frame synchronization sequence (see next section).

=== Synchronization sequence

DCS-BIOS tries to send 30 updates per second.

DCS-BIOS will send the four bytes `0x55 0x55 0x55 0x55` at the start of each update.
These do *not* specify a 65535-byte write access to the address 0x5555.
Instead, they are used by consumers of the data stream to find the start of a write access to synchronize to.

DCS-BIOS ensures that this byte sequence cannot appear in the normal data stream.
In the event that the byte sequence `0x55 0x55 0x55 0x55` would appear in a single write access, DCS-BIOS will avoid that by splitting it up into two separate writes.
